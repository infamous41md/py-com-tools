REQUIREMENTS:

Python 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7

pywin32

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/

There's no easy_install magic for pywin32, you need to download the standalone installer from the
sourceforge site.

INSTALL:

Both the standalone tool and the IDApython script require the iquery extension, which is a c++
extension to Python that provides a primitive interface to QueryInterface(). This package contains
prebuilt versions of iquery for all the versions of Python listed above. Simply copy the version you
need into the root directory of the tool:

cp iquery/Python26/_iquery.pyd .

You also need to change the interpreter line in comTool.py to point to your version of Python. It's
currently set to C:\Python26\python.exe, or just pass the script to the interpreter of your choice.

To install the IDApython script, copy the following files/directory into your IDA/python directory:

idaCOM.py
iquery.py
pyTypeLibs.py
sdk-tlbs
_iquery.pyd
